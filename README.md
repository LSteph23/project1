Technical Difficulties
•First API for Donald Trump quotes didn’t work at all and we had to find a different source.
•Finding a free Shakespeare translator was a challenge, we were initially going to pay but found one that gave us 5 free calls per hour (good things come in small doses!)
•Merging our branches:
•Had difficulty getting everybody’s most recent work to Master.•We were using copy and paste from Github which DID NOT WORK, made all buttons defunct!
•Young accidentally deleted his entire assets folder trying to pull the Master branch down.•Figuring out what the merge conflicts were and making sure we weren’t deleting something important!
